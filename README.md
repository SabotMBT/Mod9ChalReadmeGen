# Mod9ChalReadmeGen

## A simple inquirer prompt to help a user create a professional (if barebones) README file.

- As a part of my coding studies, when my assignments are graded I consistently lose points due to an incorrectly formatted README file.
- This app will prompt the user to answer a series of questions. These answers will be dynamically fed into a boilerplate form, then create a professional README.md file by dynamically insterting the user's input into the correct places.
